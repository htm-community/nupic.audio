## Potential areas of investigation

- Genre and style classification
- Musical prediction and composition
- Acoustic correlation using canonical correlation analysis (CCA)
- Transient analysis (harmonic tracking)
- Motion derivative encoding (similar to optical flow)
- Echo location and spatial positioning (e.g. Anterior Ventral Cochlea Nucleus)
- Stream segmentation and seperation (includes selective attention)
- Cortical pathways and projections, 'What' and 'Where' pathways (belts?)
- Auditory nerve spike firing (e.g. IHC to CN GBC integrators)
- Dendritic micro-circuits and synaptic placement (temporal smoothing)
- Spike-timing dependent plasticity
- Acetylcholine inhibition enhancing discharge frequency but decreasing synaptic adaption
- Acoustic related cell, and dendrite, membrane properties (cascading conductances, shunting)

An alternative for the encoding of audio signals is the modelling of _**spike firing of auditory-nerve fibers**_. A collection of models can be found in the EarLab @ Boston University (http://earlab.bu.edu/ See Modelling -> Downloadable Models). If you plan to use these models, beware of their history and limitations. For example, early models lack some necessary non-linearity in their responses.
