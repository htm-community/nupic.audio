## Basic elements

The basic elements of any sound. Our brains organize these fundamental perceptual attributes into higher level concepts. Music is perceived through multiple dimensions (attributes). These basic elements are _seperable_. As in, each can be varied without altering the others. 

**Pitch** - A purely psychological construct, related both to the actual frequency of a particular tone and to its relative position in the musical scale. The two terms, _tone_ and _note_ refer to the same entiuty in the abstract, but we reserve the word _tone_ for what you hear, and the word _note_ for what you see written on a musical score. Pitch is closely related to frequency or rate of vibration of a string, column of air, or other physical source.

**Rhythm** - Refers to the duration of a series of notes, and to the way that they group together.

**Tempo** - Refers to the overall speed or paceof the piece (how fast or slow these regular movements are).

**Contour** - Describes the overall shape of a melody, taking into account only the pattern of "up" and "down" (binary value, not an absolute/relative value).

**Timbre** - Distinguishes one instrument from another. It is a kind of tonalcolour thatis producedinpart by overtones from the instrument's vibrations. It also describes the way a single instrument can change sound as it moves across its range. 'ASA definition' of timbre; Everything about a sound that is not loudness or pitch.

**Loudness** - A purely psychological construct that relates (nonlinearly) to how much energy an instrument creates (air displacement) and what an acoustician would call the amplitude of a tone.

**Reverberation** - A perception of how distant the source is from us in combination with how large a room or hall the music is in; often referred to as "echo". An underappreciated role in communicating emotion and creating an overall pleasing sound.

## Higher-order concepts

When basic elements combine and form relationships with one another, in a meaning full way, they give rise to the following higher-order concepts;

**Meter** - Created by extracting information from rhythm and loudness cues, and refers to the way in which tones are grouped with one another across time.

**Key** - A hierarchy of importance that exists between tones in a musical piece; a hierarchy that only exists in our mind as a function of our experiences. In a major scale, the most stable tone is the first degree, also called the __tonic__.

**Melody** - The main theme of a musical piece, the succession of tones that are most salient in your mind. A notion that is different across genres.

**Harmony** - Relationships between pitches of different tones, and with tonal contexts that these pitches set up that ultimately lead to expectations for what will come next in a musical piece.

## Musical terms

The following definitions are taken in large part from _Music, Thought and Feeling_ (Thompson 2009).

**Chord** - In a musical context, a chord is a collection of tones that are played simultaneously or near simultaneously. The most common chords in Western music are major and minor chords (called triads because they consist of three tones).

**Chord (or harmonic) hierarchy** - The hierarchical stability of chords established by the key. The most stable chord is the chord built on the fi rst scale tone (the tonic chord), followed by the chord built on the fi fth scale tone (the dominant chord), and then the chord built on the fourth scale tone (the subdominant). These are also usually the most frequent chords in a musical composition.

**Key** - A concept describing the organization of a passage of music. A sense of key is determined by the establishment of two features: a scale and a tonal centre.

**Melody** - The melody is the change in pitch in a passage of music. If it is organized according to musical conventions and perceptual principles, it is wellremembered.

**Pitch** - The psychological quality of periodic sounds that extends from low to high (pitch height). In the context of music it is called a tone and when it is written down it is called a note.

**Scale** - The set of tones that represent a musical composition, and from which most or all tones in the music are drawn. In Western music, the most common scale is the major (seven-tone) diatonic scale.

**Tonality** - The quality of music that involves the use of a key or keys. Its perception involves sensitivity to a complex system of relationships, including the relationships between tones, chords, and keys and the tonal and harmonic hierarchies.

**Tonal centre (or tonic)** - The tone that functions as a point of maximum stability and minimum tension. It often appears most frequently in the music and gives the name to the scale, e.g. C is the tonal centre for the key of C major.

**Tonal hierarchy** - The hierarchy of stability of tones established by the key. The most stable tone in a major key is the fi rst tone of the scale (the tonic), followed by the fifth tone of the scale (dominant), and the third tone of the scale (mediant); the tones that are not in the scale are the least stable.
